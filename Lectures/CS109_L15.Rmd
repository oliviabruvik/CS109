# Lecture 15: General Inference {.tabset}

## Topics

## Bayesian Network
### Constructing a Bayesian Network {.tabset}
#### Bayesian Network
Each RV is caused by its parents. <br>
Def: $P(node|parents)$

- Node: random variable
- Directed edge: causality

Generative model: a good probabilistic model is generative. It explains the process through which the joint is created.

#### Bayes Nets: Conditional independence
In a bayesian network, each RV is conditionally independent of its non-descendants, given its parents. 

- Node: random variable
- Directed edge: conditional dependency

### Bayesian Network Assumption
$P(Joint) = \prod{P(x_i|x_{i-1}, ..., x_1)}$ <br>
$P(Joint) = \prod{ P(x_i | \text{Values of parents of } X_i)}$ <br>

Assume: Once you know the value of the parents of a variable in your network, $X_i$, any further information about non-descendents will not change your belief in $X_i$.

## Covariance and Correlation {.tabset}
### Covariance:
\[
\begin{aligned}
Cov(X,Y) &= E[(X-E[X])(Y-E[Y])] \\
&= E[XY] - E[Y]E[X]
\end{aligned}
\]

NB! Covariance of zero does not mean independence!

### Correlation
\[
\begin{aligned}
\rho (X,Y) = \frac{Cov(X,Y)}{\sqrt{Var(X)Var(Y)}}
\end{aligned}
\]

Correlation is just normalized covariance:
\[
\begin{aligned}
Cov(X,Y) < \sqrt{Var(X)Var(Y)} \\
Cov(X,Y) > -\sqrt{Var(X)Var(Y)}
\end{aligned}
\]

## Inference {.tabset}
An updated belief about a random variable (or multiple) based on conditional knowledge regarding another random variable (or multiple) in a probabilistic model.

### Problem: Simple Disease Model
Parents:
\[
\begin{aligned}
P(F_lu = 1) &= 0.1 \\
P(U = 1) &= 0.8
\end{aligned}
\]

Nodes:
\[
\begin{aligned}
P(F_ev = 1| F_lu = 1) &= 0.9 \\
P(F_ev = 1| F_lu = 0) &= 0.05 \\
\\
P(T = 1| F_lu = 0, U = 0) &= 0.1 \\
P(T = 1| F_lu = 0, U = 1) &= 0.8 \\
P(T = 1| F_lu = 1, U = 0) &= 0.9 \\
P(T = 1| F_lu = 0, U = 1) &= 1.0 \\
\end{aligned}
\]

Problem:
\[
\begin{aligned}
P(F_{lu} = 1 | F_{ev} = 0, U = 0, T=1)? \\
P(F_{lu} = 1 | U = 1, T=1)
\end{aligned}
\]

### Solution
```{python, eval = FALSE}
def get_prob_Xi(x, parents):
  # what is the probability that Xi = x
  # given the list parents of assignments to 
  # the parents variables Xi
```

Probability conditioning on three variables:
\[
\begin{aligned}
P(F_{lu} = 1 | F_{ev} = 0, U = 0, T=1) = \frac{P(F_{lu} = 1, F_{ev} = 0, U = 0, T=1)}{\sum_xP(F_{lu} = x, F_{ev} = 0, U = 0, T=1)}
\end{aligned}
\]

Probability conditioning on two variables:
\[
\begin{aligned}
P(F_{lu} = 1 | U = 1, T=1) = \frac{\sum_y P(F_{lu} = 1, F_{ev} = y, U = 1, T=1)}{\sum_x \sum_y P(F_{lu} = x, F_{ev} = y, U = 0, T=1)}
\end{aligned}
\]

## Rejection sampling algorithm
0. Have a fully specified Bayesian Network
1. 

$$
probability \approx 
\frac{
  \text{n(samples with } (F_{lu} = 1, U = 1, T = 1))}
  {\text{n(samples with } (U = 1, T = 1))
}
$$

Possible due to our definition of probability as a frequency.
$$
P(E) = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{n(E)}{n}
$$
