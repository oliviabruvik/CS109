# Section 7: Solution {.tabset}

## Problem 1: Binary Tree {.tabset}
### Problem
Binary Tree: Consider the following function for constructing binary trees:
```{python, eval = FALSE}
def random_binary_tree (p):
  """
  Returns a dictionary representing a random binary tree structure.
  The dictionary can have two keys , "left" and "right".
  """
  if random_bernoulli (p): # returns true with probability p
    new_node = {}
    new_node["left"] = random_binary_tree (p)
    new_node["right"] = random_binary_tree (p)
    return random_binary_tree
  else:
    return None
```


The if branch is taken with probability 𝑝 (and the else branch with probability 1 − 𝑝). A tree
with no nodes is represented by nullptr; so a tree node with no left child has nullptr for the
left field (and the same for the right child).
Let 𝑋 be the number of nodes in a tree returned by randomTree. You can assume 0 < 𝑝 < 0.5.
What is 𝐸[𝑋], in terms of 𝑝?

### Solution
\[
\begin{aligned}
E[X] &= \sum E[X|Y=y]P(Y=y) \\
&= E[X|if]P(if) + E[X|else]P(else) \\
&= (1 + 2E[X])p + 0\times (1-p) \\
&= p + 2pE[X] \\
&= \frac{p}{1-2p}
\end{aligned}
\]

## Problem 2: Timing Attack {.tabset}
### Problem
In this problem we are going to show you how to crack a password in linear time, by measuring
how long the password check takes to execute (see code below). Assume that our server takes 𝑇
ms to execute any line in the code where 𝑇 ∼ 𝑁(𝜇 = 5, 𝜎2 = 0.5) seconds. The amount of time
taken to execute a line is always independent of other values of 𝑇.

# An insecure string comparison
def string_equals (guess , password):
n_guess = len(guess)
n_password = len( password )
if n_guess != n_password :
return False # 4 lines executed to get here
for i in range(n_guess):
if guess[i] != password[i]:
return False # 6 + 2i lines executed to get here
return True # 5 + 2n lines executed to get here
On our site all passwords are length 5 through 10 (inclusive) and are composed of lower case
letters only. A hacker is trying to crack the root password which is “gobayes" by carefully
measuring how long we take to tell them that her guesses are incorrect.
a. What is the distribution of time that it takes our server to execute 𝑘 lines of code? Recall
that each line independently takes 𝑇 ∼ 𝑁(𝜇 = 5, 𝜎2 = 0.5) ms.

### Solution 
Error bar (A) = $\sqrt{6.0}$ <br>
Error bar (B) = $\sqrt{9.1}$  <br>

Null hypothesis: observed difference is by random chance.

$P(h_0) = \frac{count}{10000}$, $p-value \approx 0.12 > 0.05$
